The downloaded datasets were transformed by the following steps:

1) Merging the training and test datasets into one dataset

2) Discarding all columns except those containing the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Using descriptive activity names for the different types of activities in the dataset

4) Adding activity names to the dataset

5) Creating a new tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



Variables:
X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, Subject_train and Subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
features contains all column names
activity_labels contains the descriptions of the activities
merged_train, merged_test, merged_all contain merged data of X and Y
column_names contains all column names
mean_and_std contains those columns that contain mean or std
mean_and_std_subset contains data for only means and std
activity_names_subset contains data with a descriptive title added for the activities
new_tidy_subset contains an aggregated dataset to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
